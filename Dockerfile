# Build natively for whatever architecture this stage is running on
# (TARGETARCH is auto-populated by Docker buildx; falls back correctly
# on ARM hosts where the original hardcoded amd64 would produce a
# binary that can't execute at all).
ARG TARGETARCH
# VERSION is passed by docker-publish.yml from the resolved image tag (semver on a
# release, "edge"/branch on a plain main push); defaults to "dev" for local builds
# so `go build` without --build-arg still works as documented in CLAUDE.md.
ARG VERSION=dev
# COMMIT is stamped explicitly because this image is built from a copied source tree
# with no .git, so the Go toolchain has no VCS metadata to embed and /version would
# otherwise report commit "unknown" on every container. That matters now that branch
# images are deployable: they report version "dev", leaving nothing else to identify
# the build by.
ARG COMMIT=""
# Railway supplies this for GitHub builds; prefer it so later pushes never report
# a stale manually configured COMMIT value. CLI/local builds retain COMMIT.
